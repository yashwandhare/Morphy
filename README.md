Morphy is a lightweight, terminal-based file conversion tool that I built mainly for personal use and learning. It handles common conversions for images, PDFs, and videos through a simple, guided CLI workflow, without trying to do everything at once.

I built this project to better understand Python automation, file handling, and integrating external tools like ffmpeg, while keeping the codebase clean and structured.
